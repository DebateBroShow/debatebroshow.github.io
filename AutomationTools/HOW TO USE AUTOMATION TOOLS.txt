1. Create a new git branch named after the episode, branch off of master.
    If you don't know what this means, don't touch anything without asking me first
2. Update episode.txt
    The instructions are located inside the file, along with examples
3. run automation.py
    If you don't know how to run it, install python, if you don't know how to do that, 
    you probably don't know what git is an ignored step 1, so talk to Owen and he'll give 
    you a free lesson.
    BTW using wsl is easier than changing and environment variable, change my mind
4. observe git, there should be 9 changed files
    - 2 backups
        - index.backup, episodeIndex.backup
    - 4 new generated html files
        - 3 in the generated html files folder
        - 1 in /pages/episodefiles folder
    - 2 updated html files
        - index and episodeindex 
    - sitemap.xml 
        - tells google whats on our site, good for SEO
5. run the files locally and make sure they look good
    - since it's automated, the only real errors that can happen are in episode.txt
        - if it doesn't look good locally, just discard everything but episode.txt in git
        fix episode.txt, and then run RUNTHISFILE.py one more time
5.5 Seriously, if you entered something wrong into episode.txt, just start over, the code isn't good enough to handle errors properly
6. commit your branch to git
7. create a pull request to merge into master branch
8. Contact Owen on telegram and discord
9. Help owen debug after he merges it
10. you did great
