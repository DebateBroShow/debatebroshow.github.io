1. Create a new git branch named after the episode, branch off of master.
    If you don't know what this means, dont touch anything
2. Update episode.txt
    The instructions are located inside
3. run RUNTHISFILE.py
    If you don't know how to run it, install python, if you don't know how to do that, 
    you probably dont know what git is an ignored step 1, so talk to Owen and he'll give 
    you a free lesson
4. observe git, there should be 9 changed files
    - 2 backups
    - 4 new generated html files
        - 3 in the generated html files folder
        - 1 in /pages/episodefiles folder
    - 2 updated html files
        - index and episodeindex 
    - sitemap.xml 
        - tells google whats on our site, good for SEO
5. run the files locally and make sure they look good
    - since it's automated, the only real errors that can happen are in episode.txt
        - if it doesn't look good locally, just discard everything but episode.txt in git
        fix episode.txt, and then run RUNTHISFILE.py one more time
6. commit your branch to git
7. create a pull request to merge into master branch
8. Contact Owen on telegram and discord
9. Help owen debug after he merges it
10. you did great
